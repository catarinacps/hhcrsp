Welcome to the project lab-book! This lab-book will be mainly dedicated to the
experiments that will be done in this project.

Having that said, we'll only have two primary experiments:

1. Math solver (testing max solver time and etc)
2. Simulated Annealing (testing temperature and such)

Both experiments will use the same test instances.

* Test Configurations

As follows:

| CPU                        | Memory | Distro             | Kernel Version    |
|----------------------------+--------+--------------------+-------------------|
| Intel Core i5 4570 x 1     | 8GB    | Manjaro 18.1.3     | 4.19.84-1-MANJARO |
| Intel Xeon Silver 4116 x 2 | 94GB   | Debian 10 (Buster) | 4.19.0-6          |
